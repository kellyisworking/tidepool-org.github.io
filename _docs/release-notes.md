# Tidepool Release Notes  

Since GitHub can be a scary place if you don't know where to look, or what you're looking for, these release notes will make updates to Tidepool for Web, the Tidepool Uploader, and Tidepool Mobile a bit more readable.  

Because we love transparency, along with a description of what's new, each update includes a link out to the speicifc GitHub repository release (**Code Update**) and relevant public Trello cards (**Feature Requirements**) so you can get a better sense of who, what, when, where, and why.

### 1.10.7 (Released 2018-05-14)
We’ve added the AADE Foundation to our Tidepool Big Data Donation Project Nonprofit Partner list. Now you can choose to support an organization providing resources to diabetes educators with your data donation.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/LWBzvGMr/2-add-aade-foundation-to-tidepool-big-data-donation-project-nonprofit-partner-list)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/blip/releases/tag/v1.10.7)

### 1.10.5 (Released 2018-04-17)
We noticed when some of you created a new account and we displayed a message that says “Please click on the link in the email we sent you at (your email address)” and (your email address) would up on two lines if it was really long. We fixed that bug so now (your email address) shows up on its own line. Little details like that are important.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/67H081EV/8-put-the-email-address-on-its-own-line-so-it-doesnt-get-split)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/blip/releases/tag/v1.10.5)

### 1.10.4 (Released 2018-04-09)
Sometimes data lines in the Trends view would appear to loop around, like a weird connect-the-dots drawing. We fixed that.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/98DFbS3V/4-overlapping-lines-in-trends-view)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/blip/releases/tag/v1.10.4)

### 1.10.3 (Released 2018-03-29)
For users signing up for a new account, you can now see which email address you signed up with on our email verification page. If you accidentally typed in the wrong address (it happens to the best of us), you’ll know right away instead of wondering where that account verification email went.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/1qAvkpEH/24-blip-show-email-address-as-part-of-signup-email-verification)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/blip/releases/tag/v1.10.3)

### 1.10.2 (Released 2018-03-28)
The printed Daily view started at 5:00pm rather than midnight. Sure, time zones are weird, but we fixed that so everyone’s day starts at a logical time.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/dr9EeALW/22-print-view-daily-view-starts-at-5pm-rather-than-midnight)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/blip/releases/tag/v1.10.2)

### 1.10.1 (Released 2018-03-19)
For anyone whose iPhone CGM upload is 8 weeks (or more) more recent than a pump upload, there was a small chance you may not be able to see any of your data based on how we process things behind the scenes. We cleaned up that order of operations and you can see your data again.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/Inr3LmRc/18-cgm-only-from-dexcom-api-results-in-non-rendered-viz-due-to-data-paging)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/blip/releases/tag/v1.10.1)

### 1.10.0 (Released 2018-03-19)
Tired of watching those dots bounce while your data loads? Frustrated at seeing “Aw, snap!” if Tidepool gets bogged down by all the data you’ve uploaded? Welcome to Data Paging. We’ve reengineered how we visualize your data, reducing the time spent waiting for your data to load. Scrolling through the days/weeks is also faster, too.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/jmYSnJCw/15-tidepool-web-data-paging)

Along the way, we made some adjustments to how and where your bolus tooltips display.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/MI81nZVi/16-bolus-tooltips-are-displaying-below-the-basal-rates-in-daily-view)

## Tidepool Uploader
Visit [https://tidepool.org/uploader](https://tidepool.org/uploader) to download the latest version of the Tidepool Uploader.  

If you already have the Tidepool Uploader installed on your computer, it will automatically update to the latest version.  

### 2.6.0 (Release 2018-06-04)
Tidepool now supports Trividia Health True Metrix, True Metrix Go, and True Metrix Air blood glucose meters. If you're looking to upload one of those meters, we've combined them all under _Trividia Health True Metrix_ label in our devices list. Keeps things nice and tidy
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/OFkyZUe6/2-uploader-trividia-true-metrix-meters)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/chrome-uploader/releases/tag/v2.6.0)

### 2.5.13 (Released 2018-05-31)
Currently we import IOB data from Medtronic pumps from the Bolus Wizard Estimate of Active Insulin. However, if a manual bolus or a square wave bolus is done without the Bolus Wizard, we don't get the IOB information. This data is listed at Unabsorbed insulin and is separate from the Bolus Wizard data. Medtronic also does not include active insulin data for any Bolus Wizard boluses without an associated BG value, despite it being listed in Unabsorbed insulin. By importing Unabsorbed insulin instead of Active insulin we will be able to provide our users with more data. All of this to say we fixed that bug and now use "Unabsorbed Insulin" instead of "Active Insulin" to display IOB.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/0jpKslMv/23-change-iob-data-from-medtronic-from-active-insulin-to-unabsorbed-insulin)

We’ve made more improvements to our Uploader error-logging service, Rollbar, this time to log data anomalies for any events with a time significantly in the past or future. Time travel isn't real (yet), this update should help us understand why some uploads have a date that is way, way off.  
Feature Requirements  
[Part 1](https://trello.com/c/HFxhx2Kh/22-log-data-anomalies-to-rollbar-for-any-events-with-time-field-significantly-in-past-or-future), [Part 2](https://trello.com/c/VhJD2moG/24-add-a-rollbar-notification-for-when-a-user-gets-the-timezone-conflict-message)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/chrome-uploader/releases/tag/v2.5.13)

### 2.5.11 (Released 5/16/2018)
Tidepool now supports Medtronic Veo (554/754) insulin pumps. Yay!  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/RU2SjKA1/7-uploader-support-medtronic-veo-554-754-pump)

Bayer was acquired by Ascencia, which means all those Contour meters needed some new branding. We’ve gone with Ascencia (Bayer) to minimize confusion.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/mt2xb3qV/6-update-bayer-listing-to-ascencia-bayer)

Our friends at Medtronic removed the ability to export your data as a CSV file. We relied on that functionality to import your CareLink data into Tidepool. As a result, we’ve removed the “Upload from CareLink option in the Tidepool Uploader” (Don’t worry, you can still upload directly to Tidepool with your Contour Next Link meter.)  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/pz3ltLai/4-remove-upload-from-carelink-option)

Previously, if two consecutive square wave calculator boluses were given on a Medtronic 530G, the Tidepool Uploader interpreted the data as a single Dual Wave bolus with the extended portion of the bolus being the insulin total from the first bolus, which is listed as an override of the total. Also, if the last bolus on the 530G was a square wave bolus, data uploads failed. It’s hip to be square, but not that square - we’ve fixed both those bugs.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/izgIetxG/5-2-consecutive-square-calculator-boluses-are-merged-into-a-single-bolus-when-uploaded-from-medtronic-530g)

Finally, if an account was set up to upload devices on one operating system, you’d see “Unknown Device” on an operating system that does not support those devices. That bug has been squashed. We will remove that device from your upload options so it doesn’t look like you’re trying to upload mystery data.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/6XAazELZ/8-unknown-devices-appearing-in-uploader)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/chrome-uploader/releases/tag/v2.5.11)

### 2.5.9 (Released 4/26/2018)
We changed some of the text for our Time Check pop up to make it clear that you should triple-check the time on the device you’re trying to upload. This is somewhere between a bug fix and a new feature. Feature fix?  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/ERwBfwRa/19-update-device-time-check-copy)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/chrome-uploader/releases/tag/v2.5.9)

### 2.5.8 (Released 4/26/2018)
Dependency updates aren’t always the most exciting thing, but we want to make sure you’re getting the latest and greatest software possible, so here we are with some shiny new code under the hood of the Tidepool Uploader.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/LLQU6QaX/17-new-card-uploader-dependency-updates)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/chrome-uploader/releases/tag/v2.5.8)

### 2.5.7 (Released 4/23/2018)
Remember when we said we fixed that bug that prevented all your Libre data from uploading. This time we really, really fixed it. (To be fair, the FreeStyle Libre hasn’t been out that long, so it took a little time for larger datasets to come our way and push the boundaries of our code.)  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/UUfpJcP2/10-reading-all-the-available-data-from-a-libre-device)

For our friends with a Medtronic pump using more than 6 or 7 insulin sensitivities or carb ratios, your uploads used to fail. We fixed that bug too.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/MyWefnN2/11-upload-fails-when-a-large-number-of-insulin-sensitivities-or-carb-ratios-are-specified)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/chrome-uploader/releases/tag/v2.5.7)

### 2.5.5 (Released 4/10/2018)
Be honest, how diligent are you at keeping your devices on time when you travel? The Tidepool Uploader will now warn you if it detects a difference between the time zone selected and the time indicated on your device.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/1eAw2Fpc/2-uploader-timezones-as-a-user-i-want-the-uploader-to-warn-me-of-any-difference-between-my-device-time-and-computer-time-or-select)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/chrome-uploader/releases/tag/v2.5.5)

### 2.5.4 (Released 3/27/2018)
We found a bug that prevented every last data point on your FreeStyle Libre from uploading. That won’t be a problem anymore.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/5KPT5Iim/20-libre-uploading-with-gaps-in-data)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/chrome-uploader/releases/tag/v2.5.4)

### 2.5.3 (Released 3/16/2018)
We’ve made improvements to our Uploader error-logging service, Rollbar to catch more hiccups and bummers that you throw our way. This will go a long way to helping us identify areas we can improve our software.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/144Btqt7/13-uploader-improve-rollbar-logging)

Omnipod device settings were hell-bent on displaying as mg/dL even when uploaded from a pump set to mmol/L. We’d like to formally apologize to our friends who prefer blood glucose concentrations measured by molarity instead of weight - this bug has been fixed.  
[Feature Requirements](https://trello.com/c/KVEO8OTR/12-omnipod-showing-mg-dl-in-device-settings-even-after-mmol-l-selected-in-user-profile)

[Code Update](https://github.com/tidepool-org/chrome-uploader/releases/tag/v2.5.3)

### 2.5.1 (Released 3/12/2018)
We gave upload times for Medtronic and Tandem pumps a serious speed boost. Prior to this update, we would pull all data off compatible Medtronic and Tandem pumps and sort out duplicate data later. Now, initial uploads of compatible Tandem and Medtronic pumps will show “We've improved how devices upload. This upload will take longer than usual, but your future uploads will be much, much faster.” After that, we will only upload new data. The result? A bolus from the Speed Force and much faster uploads in the future.  
Feature Requirements

### 2.0.3 (Released 4/17/2018)  
Dexcom uploading has improved, and we’ve updated some behind the scenes components to improve performance and (if we need it) troubleshooting bugs.  
Feature Requirements...(wait for it)
